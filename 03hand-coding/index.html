        <h1>Fun Facts</h1>

        <h2>Not all Bees Produce Honey.</h2>
        <p>Less than 5 percent of bee species make honey. Only honey bees and bees that don't sting produce enough honey
            to
            make it worth harvesting. </p>


        <h2>Stingless bees</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="family.html#families"> Stingless bees</a> are usually found in tropicals areas.</li>
            <li>Stingless bees usually only polinate the area where they are found.</li>
            <li>Stinglees bee honey is pretty rare, they tipacally only make enough to sustain their hive. So when it's
                sold it's in small quantities.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Bees and Their roles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The three main roles for honey bees are drones, workers, and the queen.</li>
            <li>Drones are the male bees, they mate with the queen until the winter when they are kicked out.</li>
            <li>Worker bees are the bees that we usually see, they're the pollinators and they build and protect their
                hive.</li>
            <li>The queen runs the hive and produces bees to keep the hive alive.</li>
            <li>Worker bees usually only live <em>5-6 weeks</em>, whereas the queen can live up to <em>5 years.</em>
            </li>
